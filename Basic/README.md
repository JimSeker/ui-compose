Basic Android GUI/UI Examples
===========

`FormExample` show some simple views/widgets and listeners using only an activity

`ScreenDemoSimple` is very loosely based on fragmentDemoSimple.  The example shows how to create and use multiple "screens", which is simliar in nature to a android's concept of a fragment.

`DrawerDemoSimple` is very simple ModalNavigationDrawer (android: drawerlayout) demo with 3 screens.

`PagerDemoSimple` is a very simple HorizontalPager (or VerticalPager) demo with 3 screens.  Android view version would be a viewpager.
